\arguments{
\item{par}{parameters}

\item{landscape}{A RasterLayer with extent, res, proj used for SpaDES.tools::spread}

\item{annualDTx1000}{A list of data.table class objects. Each list element is
data from a single calendar year, and whose name is "yearxxxx" where xxxx is the 4 number
year. The columns in the data.table must integers, that are 1000x their actual values as
this function will divide by 1000.}

\item{nonAnnualDTx1000}{Like \code{annualDTx1000}, but with where each list element will be
used for >1 year. The names of the list elements must be "yearxxxx_yearyyyy_yearzzzz" where the
xxxx, yyyy, or zzzz represent the calendar years for which that list element should be used.
The columns are variables that are used for more than 1 year.}

\item{FS_formula}{Formula, put provided as a character string, not class \code{formula}.
(if it is provided as a class \code{formula}, then it invariably will have an
enormous amount of data hidden in the formula environment; this is bad for DEoptim)}

\item{historicalFires}{DESCRIPTION NEEDED}

\item{fireBufferedListDT}{DESCRIPTION NEEDED}

\item{covMinMax}{This is a 2 row by multiple column data.frame indicating
the minimum and maximum values of the original covariate data values. These will
be used to rescale the covariates internally so that they are all between 0 and 1. It is important
to not simply rescale internally here because only 1 year is run at a time; all years
must be rescaled for a given covariate by the same amount.}

\item{maxFireSpread}{A value for \code{spreadProb} that is considered impossible to go above.
Default 0.28, which is overly generous unless there are many non-flammable pixels (e.g., lakes).}

\item{minFireSize}{DESCRIPTION NEEDED}

\item{tests}{One or more of \code{"mad"}, \code{"adTest"}, \code{"SNLL"}, or \code{"SNLL_FS"}.
Default: \code{"mad"}.}

\item{Nreps}{Integer. The number of replicates, per ignition, to run.}

\item{plot.it}{DESCRIPTION NEEDED}

\item{objFunCoresInternal}{Internally, this function can use \code{mcmapply} to run multiple
parallel \code{spread} function calls. This should only be >1L if there are spare threads.
It is highly likely that there won't be. However, sometimes the \code{DEoptim} is
particularly inefficient, it starts X cores, and immediately several of them are
stopped inside this function because the parameters are so bad, only 2 year are attempted.
Then the core will stay idle until all other cores for the \code{DEoptim} iteration are complete.
Similarly, if only physical cores are used for \code{DEoptim}, the additional use of
hyperthreaded cores here, internally will speed things up (i.e., this maybe could be 2L or 3L).}
