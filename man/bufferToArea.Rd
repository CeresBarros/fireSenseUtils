\usage{
bufferToArea(
  poly,
  rasterToMatch,
  areaMultiplier,
  verb = FALSE,
  polyName = NULL,
  field = NULL,
  ...
)

\method{bufferToArea}{list}(
  poly,
  rasterToMatch,
  areaMultiplier = 1,
  verb = FALSE,
  polyName = NULL,
  field = NULL,
  ...
)

\method{bufferToArea}{SpatialPolygons}(
  poly,
  rasterToMatch,
  areaMultiplier = 1,
  verb = FALSE,
  polyName = NULL,
  field = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{poly}{SpatialPolygons or a list of SpatialPolygons, containing polygons to buffer}

\item{rasterToMatch}{A RasterLayer with res, origin, extent, crs of desired outputted
pixelID values}

\item{areaMultiplier}{Either a scalar that will buffer areaMultiplier * fireSize or
a function of fireSize. Default is 1. See \code{\link{multiplier}} for an example.}

\item{verb}{Logical or numeric related to how much verbosity is printed. \code{FALSE} or
\code{0} is none. \code{TRUE} or \code{1} is some. \code{2} is much more.}

\item{polyName}{Optional character string of the polygon layer name (not the individual polygons
on a SpatialPolygons object)}

\item{field}{Passed to \code{fasterize::fasterize}. If this is unique (such as polygon id),
then each polygon will have its buffer calculated independently for each unique value
in \code{field}}

\item{...}{passed to \code{fasterize::fasterize}}
}
\value{
A data.table (or list of data.tables if \code{poly} was a list) with 2 columns
\code{buffer} and \code{pixelID}. \code{buffer} is either \code{1} (the
original polygon) or \code{0} (in the buffer)
