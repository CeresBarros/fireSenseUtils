\usage{
makeMutuallyExclusive(dt, mutuallyExclusiveCols = list(youngAge = c("vegPC")))
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{a data.table with columns that should be mutually exclusive}

\item{mutuallyExclusiveCols}{A named list, where the name of the list element must be a single
covariate column name in \code{dt}. The list
content should be a "grep" pattern with which to match column names, e.g., \code{"vegPC"}.
The values of all column names that match the grep value will be set to \code{0}, whenever
the name of that list element is non-zero. Default is \code{list("youngAge" = list("vegPC"))},
meaning that all columns with \code{vegPC} in their name will be set to zero wherever \code{youngAge}
is non-zero.}
}
\value{
a data.table with relevant columns made mutually exclusive
